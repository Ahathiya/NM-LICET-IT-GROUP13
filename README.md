# To Do List 
Overview :

Todo list application that can create, read, update, delete, and mark completed. This application also implement filtering and pagination. Front end is developed using react and backend is developed using spring boot.

The system allows the user to enter details of the task she/he is planning to do, and the finish date of that task. To sum up, the system is built to perform all CRUD operations. REST services have been also implemented for this project.

The application built to be light, friendly, and appealing to use. So I would like to thank FreeFrontend.com for the great html/css template which I used in this project and edited it. You can find thier website in the References section and explore their amazing templates.
